M: What we've learned is the fact that he left the Level One Club, which is a drinking club in Neasden Lane, about 1:30 a.m., and we're trying to account for movements up till 2:15 a. m., because it was about that time he was found by a member of the club, an employee. He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him. W: About what time would you think that they were there? M: Just after half past one to a quarter past two. W: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short.

W: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time? M: Yes. The club closed at half past one and there may have been other people who left the club who went that way. We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well. W: As it is, I take it you haven't been able to identify them. M: No, not at this stage.

20-12,"B: I don't know if we'll be able to spare a whole day at the Ocean Park. We've only got four days in Hong Kong, remember. A: Oh right, well, in that case, I'd advise you to get there early. It opens at 10 o'clock in the morning on weekdays. Look, I think I've got a plan of the place somewhere. Let me see.., yes, here we are. You can have this. B: Thanks. A: OK I'll show you. Let's start with the lower level. See? Here? You arrive by taxi or bus or whatever here, on the right, can you see? That's the bus terminal. And you go in through the main entrance. You could go to Water World first but I think you'd better miss that out as you're short of time, you said. You see the cable cars? Well, those long lines are the wires and the little circles are the cars going up and down to the next level. Well, walk past the cable car terminal, at the bottom of the plan, and bear right past the Waterfall Gardens. Actually, have a look in, there are ducks and other birds in the pool there-it's very pretty. Then you'll see some steps up on the left. Follow that path and you'll come to the Centenary Garden which is a good place to stop and take pictures if you've got your camera. Then carry on until you're almost at the Children's Zoo. Right. I wouldn't bother to visit the zoo if I were you, it takes quite a long time to walk round. But I do recommend the ""Touch and Feed"" section opposite, as I said. It's great fun for small children. B: Ok, so we'll pay a visit there, and then what? A: You could come back a different way past the Chinese rock garden. Oh, that's lovely-do wander around if there's time. Then go down the steps to the Otter Pool-you can have a sit down there for a little while and watch the otters messing around in the water. Then back to the cable car terminal where you can catch a car to the upper level. The journey takes about ten minutes, I suppose, it's quite a long way. Now if you look at the other plan, the one for the upper level, you'll see where you arrive. B: Is this the terminal here in the bottom left hand comer? A: Yes, that's right. The fun fair is in the top left hand corner. Can you see? With ""The Dragon"" I was telling you about, and ""The Octopus"" and ""The Spider"". Do you think you'll want to go to that? B: Um, well, I think the children are a bit too young really, but they might enjoy watching other people. A: OK. Well, if you're feeling quite hungry by the time you arrive, which you probably will be, why not have a snack in the Chinese Restaurant next to the terminal? When you've finished your lunch, I would go to the Coral Reef first. It's that little building on the left hand side. ""That's where you can see fish and other underwater creatures in a kind of natural habitat. B: Right. That sounds interesting. A: It's lovely. After that, walk up to ""The Dragon"" and watch people being really scared! Then you could come down to the Ocean Theater, which is just to the left of the center of the plan- and see a performance of dolphins or maybe the killer whale. You'll have to check the times for that. There's one at two o'clock, I think. I'm not sure about the high diving, but you may be able to see that as well. If there's time, you could also carry on to the fight and have a look at Wave Cove. And finally, if you're not too exhausted by then you could return to the lower level by using the famous escalator. You'd be finished by 3:30 or 4 at the latest. B: Right, well, thanks for all your advice. Urn, we'll send you a postcard! A: I'll look forward to it.","According to one speaker, we could skip ______ if we are short of time.",Water World,the zoo,both these two places,both these two places

Mostly when people say that they never dream, what they really mean is that they don't remember their dreams or they don't think their dreams are important. The reason behind is that they might have been made fun of with a child when they first reported their dreams or it was so frightening that they just turned off dreaming completely. The other day, someone named Davis came to me and said that he used to be a great dreamer, but suddenly he stopped having dreams. I asked him what it happened. It turned out that his brother died by heart attack and he never expected that such a terrible thing would happen to a young person. Generally, when there was some frightening event and dream about it was too terrible. People prefer not to dream about it. Actually the worst thing you can do is stop dreaming. Because it means that the bad experience would be too painful to even appear in dreams. As long as you dream about it and even the dream is frightening, your mind is working on it. My personal opinion about what dreams do is that they help us deal with our problems. We see certain patterns take place in dreams. When a person is hurt deep inside, when a person is seriously ill or when a person has been really sad, if people turn off their dreams totally, it means they don't love themselves to even think about it.",Why do some people say they never have dreams according to Dr Garfield?,They forget about their dreams.,They don't want to tell the truth.,They have no bad experiences.,They forget about their dreams.

What he tried to do was to teach a male dolphin called Bass and a female called Doris to communicate with each other across a solid barrier. M: So how did he do it exactly? W: Well, first of all, he kept the two dolphins together in the same tank and taught them to press levers whenever they saw a light. The levers were fitted to the side of the tank next to each other. If the light flashed on and off several times, the dolphins were supposed to press the left-hand lever followed by the right-hand one. If the light was kept steady, the dolphins were supposed to press the levers in reverse order. Whenever they responded correctly, they were rewarded with fish. M: Sounds terribly complicated. W: Well, that was the first stage. In the second stage, Doctor Bastian separated the dolphins into two tanks. They could still hear one another, but they couldn't actually see each other. The levers and light were set up in exactly the same way except that this time it was only Doris who could see the light indicating which lever to press first. But in order to get their fish, both dolphins had to press the levers in the correct order. This meant of course that Doris had to tell Bass whether it was a flashing light or whether it was a steady light. M: So did it work?

My mother and sisters have a lot to do with who I am. I also learned many lessons, good and bad, which have made me a strong adult. They have helped me realize what I need to do to be happy. My mother has always been the best person in my life. She has never let me down, and has always been very supportive. Whenever I needed a friend, she was one. My sisters have also been there for me. When my morn was getting her college degree, she would be out late, and my sisters stepped in and played morn. They are my best friends and give me great advice.

W: Wow, it's quite easy to describe. Basically, when I read a word or even think of a particular word, such as Tuesday, I see a color connected with it. It's not that I imagine a color. I really see it loading in front of my eyes. M: How interesting! Is it a sort of medical condition? W: Yes. And just recently doctors have begun to understand it more. They call it synesthesia, which means that somewhere in my brain, there are links between sections that should really be separate. Other people have a form of this condition that affects emotions.

M: Do you have any brothers or sisters with the same ability? W: Yes, my brother is the same as me. If we start talking about it, people think we are completely mad.

It does make you aware of your moods. I know when I started to feel depressed, things begin to look grey. M: Are there any other advantages do you find? W: Well, it seems that quite a lot of artists and musicians have this condition. So I guess it can be beneficial if it's combined with some sort of gift or natural talent, which is not the case with me unfortunately.

Marriage thrives on a give-and-take policy, so a couple will have to learn to adapt to each other's customs and traditions. M: That's right.

It is only after marriage that the vast differences in the cultures begin to show.

20-99,"Interviewer: What were the things in Britain that you found most strange when you first arrived? Mathew: Well, the first thing is driving on the wrong side of the road..., that would be the- that was very strange because you have this automatic reflex when you go out into the street to look one way and a couple of times I did that and I almost got hit by cars and bikes and all, you know. It's dangerous. It really is dangerous. And you have to teach yourself to look the other way. Interviewer: Someone said that Britain and the United States are divided by a common language. Have you had any difficulties with the language here? Mathew: Oh, yeah-tremendous amount of difficulty but I'm starting to pick it up now-all the lingo and slang and all those-but there's definitely a difference. Interviewer: Can you give me any example? Mathew: Well, the big-I'd say some of the biggest ones would be the word ""queue"" which means in America ""line"". I never heard the word ""queue"" before. Um-what you call ""chips"", I call ""French fries"". I never heard them called ""chips"". Urn-there's so many-urn-words that are different. Ah-"" crisps"" which mean "" potato chips"" Yeah, that's - we call them ""potato chips"" or ""chips"" in America. You call them ""crisps"" here. So when I heard the word ""chips"", I was thinking of ""crisps"" and not French fry-you know-it's very confusing but-urn-but just some of the expressions like-er-"" mate"" you know and ""love"". Those-you know--they're funny. You don't hear them. You don't hear them in America. Interviewer: What about with young people-with people your own age-I mean, do you notice differences there? Mathew: I do notice some differences-er-I think-ah-I think the younger people in Britain are-they seem to be-much more radical than the younger people in the United States. I noticed that. Ah-the dress is different. You see a lot of-I see a lot of males here with earring in one of their-in one of their ears. You don't see that in America that much. Somet-maybe here and there, but not, not like you see it here. Ah-so many of the young people wear black-clothing-you know, I don't-you don't see the other colors. At home you see all different types of bright colors-and in England you see so much black. Especially on the women. Interviewer: You don't like that? Mathew: Not really. It's just my own preference. I like-I'd rather see different colors here and there-not all-not all one color. Everyone looks like Madonna. Interviewer: When you say ""radical""-do you-are you just thinking of clothes or of anything else? Mathew: Um-no, I think-er-radical as in going against the norms-could you say? Not only in clothing but I think in politics too whereas in America-er-you don't find that as much. Oh, also, another difference is the young-er-the younger people are-they're more politically aware on a larger level. See a lot of the-a lot of the Americans- they're aware of-er-government of the United States and maybe a few other countries but not as many countries in Europe or they just have a vague understanding of how those other countries are run-not as widespread. Whereas here, I think that they- er-the kids get to know about how different countries are run at a much younger level and they know all about the United States and how it's run. Interviewer: What do you think the reasons are for that? Mathew: Urn-that's a good question-urn-well, I think that the reasons are-just because of the Press. You hear so much about America here that people are-they're into it-they want to know what it's about and how it's run. And so many of our policies in America affect Britain that they want to understand how policies are made and all that and seeing that that doesn't work on the other level like Britain's policies don't-I mean, they can affect us, but not to as great an extent and therefore you don't hear as much about Britain and people don't know as much about it.",Who is the interviewee?,An American youth.,A British youth.,An Irish youth.,An American youth.

Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American.

M: I am glad you asked that. Actually when an inventor has a patent, it's enforceable by the laws in the country where the inventor developed the invention. If anyone makes and sells the product then the inventor can take them to civil court. W: What can the inventor expect to receive if he sues and wins? M: Well, there are different things the court could do, but there's no guarantee. There's a good chance the court could award him compensation and orders to stop the manufacture and sale of goods. It may well be that the goods would be ordered to be destroyed. W: Can the other person being sued do anything to help themselves? M: That's the beauty of the whole thing.

W: You said the inventor is protected by the laws of the country. Is everything equal? Do all countries have the same law? M: No, they're not all equal. You're right. It's only in theory. It is being worked on. The World Trade Organization has developed an agreement, Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which makes sure that the patent is valid for 20 years. W: That doesn't make sense. Twenty years is a long time. M: Actually, it does. It's believed that inventors make and sell goods faster after they register the patent because there's a 20-year limitation on the patent. On the other hand, other inventors can use the information the inventor disclosed when the product was registered. Giving the information is all part of the deal.

1-91,"Lisa: Hi, Tim. So, are you doing some last-minute shopping before the weekend? Tim: Well, actually, I'm looking for supplies to put together 72-hour kits for each member of my family. Lisa: [A] 72-hour kit? What's that? Tim: Basically, a 72-hour kit contains emergency supplies you would need to sustain yourself for three days in case of an emergency, like an earthquake. Lisa: An earthquake?! We haven't had an earthquake in years. Tim: Well, you never know; you have to be prepared. Hey, if earthquakes don't get you, it could be a flood, hurricane, snowstorm, power outage, fire, alien attack. [Alien attack!] Well, you never know. Think of any situation in which you might find yourself without the basic necessities of life, including shelter, food, and water, for over a period of time. Lisa: Hum. So, what do you keep in a 42-hour, um, ... I mean 72-kit? Tim: Well, you should have enough food and water to last you three days, and you might want to pack a basic water filter or water purification tablets in case your only water source turns out to be a murky pool of bug-infested water. [Ugh!] Hey, sometimes you don't have a choice, and as for food, you should keep it simple: food that requires no preparation and that doesn't spoil. And no canned goods because they are often too heavy and bulky. [Okay, that makes sense.] And unless you have a can opener or the can has a pull-tab lid, you'll have to use a rock or something to open them. [Ah, instant mashed green beens.] Yeah, and oh, energy bars, beef jerky, and a mix of nuts, raisins, and chocolate are possibilities. Lisa: Huh, the food might be nasty, but I guess you could survive ... barely. Tim: Well, the food doesn't have to taste bad; just select things that are easy to prepare, and you might want to include some basic comfort foods like a couple of candy bars. Then, you have to decide on the type of shelter you might need. Lisa: A hotel sounds nice. Tim: Yeah, but that's really not an option. The reality is that you might have to evacuate to a shelter, possibly with hundreds or thousands of other people. Lisa: That doesn't sound very fun ... everyone packed together like sardines in a can. Unsanitary conditions. Disease. Tim: Ah, now you're sounding paranoid, but if a shelter isn't available, you might be completely on your own, so I always pack an emergency sleeping bag or small, lightweight tent in the event that I have to survive on the street or in a park. Lisa: Wow. Tim: And among other things, you should pack a flashlight, portable radio, extra batteries, a small first-aid kit, personal items like a toothbrush or toothpaste ... Having a change of clothing is also important. Lisa: What about money? I have a credit card. Tim: Right. Like that's going to help when the power is out. You'd better be prepared with coins and cash, and having small bills is a must. Lisa: So, what do you do to communicate with other family members in case you get separated? Tim: Oh, in that case? I always pack two-way radios to communicate with the group. You can never depend on cell phones. [Okay.] Plus, you should decide on a meeting point in case your family gets separated. Lisa: Well, that sounds like a detailed plan, definitely. Tim: Oh, that's not all. You never know what weather conditions you might encounter, so packing a rain poncho, a jacket, and something to start a fire with could be very useful. Lisa: Like Matches? Tim: Matches? (If) You drop those in a puddle of water, you're toast. You need to pack at least three forms of fire starter: a magnifying glass, a high-quality lighter, and waterproof matches. Lisa: Wow. I never thought about those either. So, what do you do if you have small kids? They'd probably go stir-crazy under such conditions. Tim: You're exactly right, so a little extra preparation for them is needed. If you have to evacuate to a shelter to wait out a disaster, kids soon will be bored out of their minds, so you have to pack small card games, paper, or something like pencils or crayons to draw with. Lisa: You know, preparing a 72-hour kit makes perfect sense ... Tim: Yeah, but most people thinking about it after it is too late.",What kind of emergency does the man NOT mention?,power failure,snowstorm,tornado,tornado

19-0,"M: Mary, have you ever wondered why some cultures have more proverbs than others? For example, the Mayans, the Incas, and the North American Indian tribes seem to have fewer proverbs than cultures like, the Arabians, and the Chinese. I wonder why this is. W: What would you say about our ... our own culture? Would you say we're a culture that's rich in proverbs or one that lacks proverbs? M: I think we, we have a rich heritage of proverbs - the Benjamin Franklin maxims, proverbs, wise sayings have been handed down to us. W: Well, I think the fact that we're no longer creating proverbs today maybe says something ... maybe perhaps explains to some extent why proverbs in certain cultures were not as extended or extensive as in other cultures. M: Mm, hmm. That's true. I wonder why we are not creating as many proverbs as we did in 1700s and 1800s. I agree with you. I don't think there are nearly as many. I can't think of any. I'm sure there are some, but I wonder why this is so. W: Yeah, well, I think we all know a great many proverbs. If we sit down, we can think of some that we can ... we can list. But we don't seem to use them to explain things. We find many times that they're used too much and too simple - too general. Today we're much more sophisticated, you might say, and analytical, and therefore we don't use proverbs to explain things the way, say, our grandfathers and parents did. M: Life is too complicated now to just quote a simple proverb to take care of things. W: Right, and maybe to some extent that's why the North American Indians and the Mayans among others don't have as many proverbs. At least there's no record of as many proverbs. Since their own culture ... their traditions were highly eroded and they were wiped out during this era of change.

20-62,"W: We all know that poetry is not everyone's cup of tea. But according to Dr James Stewart. M: Hello! W: Hello! If you are suffering from anxiety or depression, poetry may be the solution to your problems. Dr Stewart, how does poetry help? M: Em, OK! Look, let me give you an example. A patient came into our clinic last month. He was a middle-aged businessmen, and he was feeling, well, like most middle-aged businessmen, really stressed and with his life out of control. He talked to me about it, and, well, I was convinced that medication just wouldn't help him. Then I read him a poem called Leisure by WHDavis. Do you know the one? It begins, er... W: I do, yes. M: What is this life, er, so full of. It is so or if... W: I think it's if. M: If full of care, that's it, yes. We have no time to stand and stare. Well, you know the one. The next time he came to see me, he told me that, well, it was a sort of turning point for him. The poem made him think about the quality of his life and the need to find a balance between his work and his social life. Er, you see, because the idea was expressed poetically, he felt that he could identify with it, and actually feel the message in a way that he wouldn't if he simply discussed it with me. And we just had the usual kind of conversation about it. W: Yes, I see. M: You see, reading poetry to patients seems to make them calmer. Encouraging them to write it has an even more dramatic effect, actually. Era, there.., there are something about the process of expressing confused thoughts and feelings and emotions in writing that actually helps people or suffering from stress and anxiety. This happens especially if the words are written in a poetical way with a sense of rhythm rather than in prose, you see. Er, now, for a long time, we've been asking patients to write diaries to put their feelings into words. But it turns out that writing poetry seems to work much better for many patients. W: Right, and have you found that other doctors and therapists have made the same discoveries? M: Yes, many of my colleagues have successfully used poetry with patients suffering from anxiety or depression or even eating disorders. I mean their patients said that, that reading poetry made them feel less stressed. You know, almost as many said that writing it has the same effect. You see, some said that writing poetry reduced the pain they felt when a friend or a close relation had died extraordinarily! W: Yes, it certainly is! M: Era. Others thought that it enabled them to reduce or stop taking antidepressants or tranquillizers. And writing poetry helps them to provide a sort of outlet for their emotions. W: Em, that's fascinating! Can you give any explanation as to why poetry might be calming in this way? M: Well, it's only a guess. But I say that the calming effect of poetry is related to an interplay between the left and right hemispheres of the brain, the.., you probably know the left half is the one which analyzes and responds to language while the right one visualizes images and responds to rhythm. Now, I believe that poetry may activate the system at the base of the brain where thoughts meet emotions, you see. W: Do you think that people need a doctor to prescribe particular poems for particular conditions? M: No, no, no. I think poetry can help everyone to feel calm and less stressed. People who read poetry tend not to be anxious and stressed, probably because they are in touch with their emotions. I mean they certainly don't need a doctor to tell them which poems to read.

20-120,"M: Mary, you know I've been thinking about applying for a job in Germany. Well, I've got the details about different jobs and I'd like your opinion about which would be the best one to go for. F: Where are the jobs? M: One's in Munich, one's in Frankfurt and the other one's in Hamburg. F: Munich's supposed to be a very nice place. M: Yes it is, and it's also in a beautiful part of Germany, not far from the Alias. F: That would be great for the kids--they'd love to be able to go skiing at weekends! M: But, one problem with Munich is that it's growing very fast. That means the cost of living will probably be very high. F: It's a higher salary than the job in Frankfurt but lower than the one in Hamburg. The Hamburg job has the most responsibility. From the point of view of career progression that would probably be the best job for me. F: Hamburg's the closest to Britain, too, so it would be easy to come back for long weekends and holidays. M: That's right, and there's a regular ferry service which would save quite a bit on fares. F: What about the cost of living in Germany as a whole? How does it compare with Britain? M: Well, it's definitely higher than over here, but salaries are substantially higher, so we'd certainly be better off than we are now. F: And what about accommodation? M: Well, actually, flats are much cheaper to rent in towns like Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg than they are here in London, so we'd be able to afford to live in a nice, spacious flat, I'd think. F: Mmm, that'd be nice! And do you know what the cultural facilities are like in these cities? M: In fact, they're quite good in all three. But, of course, Munich has an international reputation as a cultural center. F: Another thing we'll have to consider, of course, are the educational possibilities. How long would you want to go to Germany for? M: I think a maximum of five years. I think working overseas will be good for my career and, of course, it'd be a good experience for you and the kids, too! F: So we'd be there long enough to enable John to complete a university course. M: Well, yes we would, unless of course he preferred to go to a university in the UK. But, yes, if he did want to go to university in Germany, there'd be no problem as each of those cities have their own universities. Munich, in fact, has the second largest university in Germany. F: Well, it seems to me the choice must be between Hamburg and Munch. Hamburg has the advantage of being the closest to Britain, so coming home would be relatively easy and inexpensive. Munich, on the other hand, sounds like the most interesting place from a cultural point of view. M: I agree with you. Personally, I favor Munich because it's so near to the Alps. We all like sliding and we could go skiing at weekends in the winter. F: I think you're right. I had thought Hamburg might be preferable because it's the closest to Britain. But we'll only be abroad for five years, and if we're going to be away, let's choose the most attractive place we can. M: Right. That's agreed.

W: What about the situation in which you aren't in a mood to laugh?

Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory? W: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet. M: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease? W: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease. M: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot? W: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories. M: Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories? W: Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label.
