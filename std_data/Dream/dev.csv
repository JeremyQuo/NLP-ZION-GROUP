The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher. Caller: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay. What's the rent?

Caller: Well, the rent includes gas and electricity, but not the phone bill. And the water pump is right out the back door. Caller: Water pump! [Yeah.] Oh, yeah. Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time?

Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine. Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants? Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year. Caller: Uh ... I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning?

Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located? Apartment Owner: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant. Caller: Ah .... Are pets allowed? Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that. Caller: Um, I have a rat ...

5-767,"W: Mr. Green, is it fair to say that negotiation is an art? M: Well, I think it's both an art and science. You can prepare for a negotiation quite scientifically, but the execution of the negotiation has quite a lot to do with one's artistic quality. The scientific part of a negotiation is in determining your strategy. What do you want out of it? What can you give? Then of course there are tactics. How do you go about it? Do you take an opening position in a negotiation which differs from the eventual goal you are heading for? And then of course there are the behavioral aspects. W: What do you mean by the behavioral aspects? M: Well, that's I think where the art comes in. In your behavior, you can either be an actor. You can pretend that you don't like things which you are actually quite pleased about. Or you can pretend to like things which you are quite happy to do without. Or you can be the honest type negotiator who's known to his partners in negotiation and always plays everything straight. But the artistic part of negotiation I think has to do with responding immediately to cues one gets in the process of negotiation. These can be verbal cues or even body language. This is where the artistic quality comes in. W: So really, you see two types of negotiator then, the actor or the honest one. M: That's right. And both can work. I would say the honest negotiator can be quite effective in some circumstances. In other circumstances you need an actor.",When is a scientific approach best embodied in a negotiation according to the man?,In giving concessions.,In the concluding part.,In the preparatory phase.,In the preparatory phase.

1-50,"Rental Car Agent: Hi. How can I help you? Customer: Yeah. I'd like to rent a mid-size car for three days. Rental Car Agent: Okay. Let me check to see if we have one available. Hmmm. It's doesn't look like we do. We have a couple of economy, compact, and full-size cars available, or a nice minivan. Customer: Well, what is the main difference between these cars? Agent: The main difference is size. The economy car is the smallest, and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage. [Okay.] How many people are with you? Customer: Just me and my son. Rental Car Agent: Well, the economy car would work. We have one right out front. Customer: Where? That one? It looks more like a shoebox to me. I'm really tall and trying squeeze into that thing ... I don't think so. Rental Car Agent: Well, if you need more room or comfort, I recommend the full-size car. It also has a nice stereo system, CD player, [Alright] safety rear door locks, and cruise control, and power locks and windows. Customer: Well, I'm not so concerned about how it's equipped. I just want to make sure it is comfortable to drive. And what is the daily rate for that anyway? Rental Car Agent: Well, let's see here. Oh, yeah. It'll come to fifty-seven ninety-five a day. Customer: Wow, a little expensive. But what's the cost for mileage? Rental Car Agent: Hey, all of our cars have unlimited miles, but of course, that doesn't include gas. Customer: Yeah, right. I bet that car probably eats up gas, and now that were in the middle of the vacation season, gas stations are gouging consumers with astronomical prices. Rental Car Agent: Well, as they say, it comes down to the law of supply an demand. Customer: Well, anyway, can you install a car seat in one of those cars? I have a 3-year-old son with me. Rental Car Agent: Sure, and that'll only be one dollar extra per day. Customer: I'll go with the full-size car. Wait, uh ... what does it look like? Rental Car Agent: Uh, it's right out there in the parking lot. [Which one?] The one over there next to the sidewalk. Customer: Do you mean that old lemon with the missing hubcap? Ahhh. Rental Car Agent: Sir, excuse me. We take pride in our vehicles. It's just that it's one of the last cars on our lot, but it runs like a dream. Don't let the exterior fool you. Hey, I'll even give you an extra fifteen dollars off the daily rate to show you we are serious about pleasing our customers. Will there be any other drivers? Customer: No, I'm the only driver. Rental Car Agent: Okay. Would you like to purchase our daily car protection plan? Customer: What's that exactly? Rental Car Agent: Well, the car protection plan is a complete insurance package covering damage to the vehicle, [Okay] injury or loss of life to you or your passengers [Oh]. It even includes incidental road damage caused by, let's say, a huge boulder rolling down the mountain and crushing your car. [Oh, uh, well ... ]. However, it won't cover loss of property due to theft. Too much crime in the area anyway. [What? Wh ... What about this crime? What, what?]. Don't worry about it. And the car protection plan is only seventeen ninety-five per day. [But you were saying?] And the nicest thing about this coverage is that you can rent the car without the worry and hassle of making a complicated claim in case you do have a problem. Customer: But wouldn't my own car insurance cover those problems? Rental Car Agent: It might, but each insurance policy is different. With our car protection plan, however, you deal directly with us in case there is a problem [Well ... ], and we handle everything quickly, and you don't have to contact your own insurance company. Okay. Let me just confirm this. A full-size car with a car seat for three days [Yeah], plus the car protection package. Is that right? [That's right.] Okay, I'll have our mechanic, Louie, check the car over and pull it up to the door. Customer: Push it up to the door? I hope this car really runs. Rental Car Agent: Well, in case it does break down on some out-of-the-way, deserted road, just call the toll-free number for assistance. They'll come to assist you within ... two business days.
