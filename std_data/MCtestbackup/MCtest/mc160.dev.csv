I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all ofthe time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to ""say"" toother lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried andshort. Then there is the ""where are you"" call which is long, slow and loud. But this soundwas not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spotanything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totallygiven up weeding.
